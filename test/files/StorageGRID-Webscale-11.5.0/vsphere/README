VMware vSphere Installation Instructions
========================================

For full installation documentation, please review the "Installation Guide for VMware" for this release.

Step 1 - Deploy the primary admin node

  In vSphere click deploy OVF template and pick the vsphere-primary-admin.ovf included in this package.
  Choose a name for the node along with the location, cluster, datastore, disk format, and network.
  Configure the network IP information and name for this node.
  Click next and finish to begin the upload of the VM

Step 2 - Deploy other nodes

  In vSphere click deploy OVF template and pick the <node type>.ovf included in this package.
  Choose a name for the node along with the location, cluster, datastore, disk format, and network.
  Configure the network IP information and name for this node.
  Configure the IP address of the primary admin node
  Click next and finish to begin the upload of the VM
  Repeat this step until all required nodes have been deployed

Step 3 - Add storage to storage nodes

  In the vSphere client right click on each storage node and click edit settings.
  Three 4TB disks for RangeDBs have been provided for simple POCs.
  You may need to remove these and configure as appropriate four your environment.

Step 4 - Start the VMs

  On each node VM deployed click start.

Step 5 - Complete the StorageGRID configuration.

  Browse to the primary admin IP (You will have to wait until this VM has fully booted)
  Select 'Install a new StorageGRID Webscale'
  Proceed with the 8 configuration steps to configure the license, NTP, DNS, passwords, and approve the nodes joining the grid.
  On the summary page, click "Install" to complete installation and once completed you will be redirected to the Management Interface
